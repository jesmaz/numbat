3.1: Semicolons

Numbat's formal grammar used semicolons ';' as terminators. Semicolons are automatically inserted at the end of a line under the following conditions:
 - The final token is an identifier (alphanumeric operators are considered to be identifiers)
 - The final token is a numeric literal
 - The final token is a string literal and the first token of the next line is not a string literal
 - Same as above for character array literals
 - The final token is the 'break', 'continue', or 'return' keyword
 - The final token is one of the following symbols: ')', ']', '}'

3.2: Comments

Numbat has two forms for comments:
 - Line comments start with a '#' and terminate at end of the line
 - General comments start with a '#|' and end with a '|#'

Comments can nest.

3.3: Identifiers

Identifiers name program entities such as structures, functions, variables, and interfaces. The leading character in an identifier must be a letter or an underscore.

3.4: Keywords

Numbat has a number of identifiers reserved as keywords, they are as follows:
```
and   as   break  case   continue const     def     else    extern
false for  goto   if     import   interface label   nil     not
or    true ref    return struct   switch    typedef while
```

3.5: Numeric literals

Two kinds of numeric literals are supported, integers and floating point numbers. There are no imaginary or complex literals.

Integer literals are described as follows:
```
IntLiteral			=>	['1' ... '9'] ('0' ... '9')+
					|	'0' ('b' | 'B') ('0' | '1')+
					|	'0' ('o' | 'O') ('0' ... '7')+
					|	'0' ('x' | 'X') ('0' ... '9' | 'a' ... 'f' | 'A' ... 'F')+
```

Integer examples:
```
7
39
120
0x3f
0o70
0b0101
```

Floating point literals are defined as follows:
```
FloatLiteral		=>	['0' ... '9']* '.' ('0' ... '9')+ [('e' | 'E') ['+' | '-'] ('0' ... '9')+] ['f' | 'F' | 'h' | 'H' | 'q' | 'Q']
```

Float examples:
```
3.14
0.46
0.6e10
0.5622E-20
40.3f
30.1h
60.0q
```

3.6: Operators and delimiters:

The following tokens are operators and delimiters:
```
++ -- ( ) [ ] { } . + - ! not ~  *  /  %  +  -  <<  >>  &  ^  |  <  <=  >  >=  ==  !=  and  or  ,  =  += -= *= /= %= <<= >>= &= ^= |= =>
```
